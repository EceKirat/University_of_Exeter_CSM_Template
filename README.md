# Readme for the University_of_Exeter_CSM_Template for LaTeX

This is a LaTeX template for research theses at Camborne School of Mines (University of Exeter) but is completely adaptable for your use. 

We completely acknowledge that this template was initially adapted from an Oxford Mathematics template.

It combines aspects of the theses of Chris Yeomans and Robert Pell.

Feel free to fork and send pull requests as appropriate - I'll only be maintaining this based on user feedback!

Cheers,
Chris
